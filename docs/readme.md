# Introduction  
Doraemon is a **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)** based monitor system ,which are made up of three components——the Rule Engine,the Alert Gateway and the Web-UI.Instead of configuring alarm rules in config file,this system can configure alarm rules dynamically through the Web-UI and integrates many customized alarm functions.

# Terminology  
- Rules:The same as **[alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#alerting-rules)** in prometheus.  
- Data Source:The endpoint of prometheus server to which the rules will be sent by the Rule Engine.
- Alarm Group:A set of username that the alarms will be sent to.
- Duty Group:The same as alarm group,however,it's taken from an interface dynamically. 
- Alarm Delays:A alarm will be sent to receivers after the time duration which is called alarm delays.
- Alarm period:The period of sending alarms to receivers.
- Alarm Plan:The set of alarm strategies.
- Alarm Method:For internal users,one can send alerts by LANXIN,SMS and CALL.The others can use the HOOK,which will send alarms to a http sever by which user can handle alarms in their own way.
- Alarm Strategy:Include the configuration of alarm delays,alarm period,alarm receivers,duty groups,alarm groups and alarm method.
- Confirm Alarms:If you want to stop receiving alarms in a short time,then you can confirm the alarms by filling in the duration.
- Maintain Group:If you want to stop receiving alarms triggered by some hosts within a certain period of time in a long time,you can create a maintain group for those hosts.
